Over the course of his career, he made the discipline of enterprise shared services a key asset at American Express (Amex). In doing so, John helped to steer this $55B company through numerous economic cycles; supported growth, removed cost; applied technological innovation; and contributed to record levels of merchant and card member satisfaction. John brings broad intelligence gained from growing organizations and teams in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. He is a leader known for stepping outside the top-floor bubble and rolling up his sleeves to get results.    John was last Executive Vice President, Enterprise Transformation at Amex.

During his tenure, 3,000 employees delivered smooth day-to-day operations for real estate, enterprise automation, supply management, customer fulfillment, internal consulting, and sales enablement. When COVID-19 upended the operating environment and drove an unheard of 80% increase in disputes, John helmed Amex’s return to normality for merchants and card members.     Previously John was Senior Vice President, Global Servicing Network (GSN). There, he spearheaded deployment of robotics process automation for GSN’s $2B cost base and generated $10M annually of benefits to the wider team. John also addressed persistent friction in the merchant experience by digitizing much of the operations, creating well-received customer-facing options, and making the platform available in 22 markets.     In 2010, John helped found the GBS group, a strategic decision that made Amex an early adopter of this enterprise-wide shared services model. He then led the global finance operations as Senior Vice President, Global Financial Operations, Global Business Services Group.     Outside Amex, John chaired the GBS Council at The Conference Board, an industry think tank.

"Michael Johnson","Olympic Legend","World Champion","https://eco-cdn.iqpc.com/eco/images/speakers/L7OVQbvJOcnIAx4YiAEyX0m48OuRvjNWcbhxTeMx.png","One of the most distinctive sprinters in the history of track and field with his powerful,   upright stride pattern, Michael is widely regarded as one of the greatest sprinters of all   time. Four times an Olympic champion and eight times a world champion, he piled up a   career total of 12 Olympic and World Championship gold medals by the time he retired   from competition after the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Between 1990 and 1997, he   created a remarkable sequence of 58 consecutive wins over 400 meters.   He also strung together a winning streak of 32 races over 200 meters between 1990   and 1992. He is the only person to hold both the 200 meters and 400 meters world   records and is the only male athlete to defend successfully the Olympic 400 meters   crown.   His first Olympic gold came in Barcelona in 1992 when he was a member of the   winning American 4 x 400 meters relay team. Four years later in 1996 at Atlanta, he   became the only athlete in more than 100 years of Olympic history to clinch the double   over both 200 and 400 meters. He set a world record with his time of 19.32 seconds in   the 200 meters.  At the 1999 World Championships in Seville, Michael shattered the 11-year-old 400   meters world record of Butch Reynolds when he clocked 43.18 seconds - his fourth   successive title over the distance. He also added gold in the 4 x 400 meters relay in   Seville, which took him to a career total of eight World Championship gold medals. At   the age of 32, he rounded off his distinguished Olympic career with his fourth and fifth   gold medals at the 2000 Sydney Games, winning the 400 meters and being part of the   winning American 4 x 400 meters relay team. In 2008, Michael, always a staunch   advocate of zero tolerance for drug cheats, announced that he was returning the gold   medal from that relay, when one of the members of that relay admitted to doping.   Michael retired from competition as world-record holder over both 200 and 400   meters, a four time Olympic and eight time World Champion. After leaving the track   Michael established himself as a sought after business performance speaker and   coach, transferring Olympic performance into business success. His appeal is global,   taking him to all corners of the world to share the behaviors and strategies that lead   to greatness, while inspiring employees and leaders of some of the world's leading   corporations. Michael is well known as a multiple award winning television   commentator for BBC and documentary presenter. An entrepreneur at heart, Michael   started Michael Johnson Performance in 2007 with a mission of helping other athletes   reach their full athletic potential. As CEO and founder, Michael led MJP to become a   global leader in sports performance training, with clients throughout the world","Main Conference Day Two","2024-01-30","17:20:00","Determination, High Performance & Relentless Personal Reinvention: An Inspirational Conversation with the Olympic Legend Michael Johnson","In the world of sports, few names resonate with the sheer dominance, determination, and triumph like Michael Johnson.

He is the only person to hold both the 200 meters and 400 meters world records and is the only male athlete to defend successfully the Olympic 400 meters crown. After leaving the track, Michael’s journey took another inspiring turn. In addition to successfully pivoting to become an award-winning commentator and presenter, Michael has also started Michal Johnson Performance in 2007 with a mission to helping other athletes reach their full potential. His career reinvention didn’t stop there, today Michal is a sought-after business performance speaker and coach, transferring key insights from Olympic performance into business success. Michael’s journey truly embodies the essence of relentless pursuit and commitment to excellence, high performance, and courageous personal and career reinvention.
We couldn’t have imagined a more fitting keynote speaker for the 25th OPEX Week: Business Transformation World Summit where his dedication for performance, hard work and determination will undoubtedly be a huge inspiration to all our business and transformation leaders. They, too, are faced with similar challenges and seek excellence and greatness in their daily transformation endeavours.
